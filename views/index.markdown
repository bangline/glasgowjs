The Glasgow JavaScript User Group has arrived. Hot on the heels of the successful ScotlandJS conference.

The meetup will take place in or around Glasgow city centre on the **first Tuesday** of the month. All are welcome, from newbs to casual users, regular JS hackers to anyone who is just plain curious.

There are a few details still to be ironed out for the first meeting such as venue, sponsorship and speakers. If you are interested in speaking or indeed sponsoring the meetup then please get in touch at [info@glasgowjs.com](mailto:info@glasgowjs.com).
